# Soundboard
Pretty much what it says on the tin! It's a simple idea, just pick the sounds you want the buttons to play, and then you can assign images to these sounds.
There's a "how to" stored in the application itself, but I'll copy it into here as well.
## How to add audio?
	1. Select an audio
    		a. Simply press the button that says add things
		b. Select your sound to get added to the board
	2. Select a photo
    		a. Want a photo to click instead of that garden variety button?
		b. Hit that add things button again, and pick a photo!
	3. Select which audio that photo is for
    		a. Pick what audio you want that photo to represent
## Branch Design
The develop branch is the latest working "beta" version of the program, with all the little bells and whistles I'm adding onto it.
The master branch is the "release" version of the code, the latest version of the program that I'd consider ready for the general public. (The first commit is just my initial working idea)
The feat/ branches are the branches where I actually develop new and exciting features. 
The above is my standard branch design choices for all my projects, and unless otherwise stated, that's how I have things set up.
