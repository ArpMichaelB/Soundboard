# Soundboard
Pretty much what it says on the tin! It's a simple idea, just pick the sounds you want the buttons to play, and then you can assign images to these sounds.
There's a "how to" stored in the application itself, but I'll copy it into here as well.
## How to add audio?
1. Select an audio
  * Simply press the button that says add sounds
  * Select your sound to get added to the board
2. Select a photo
  * Want a photo to click instead of that garden variety button?
  * Hit that add photos button, and select a photo!
3. Select which audio that photo is for
  * You'll see a list of available audios to pick for!
4. Select a board
  * You'll be given a list of boards to pick from.
  * You can also make another board file by typing the name in the text box, and select that button to make a new board.
5. Start a board
  * This simply starts the board you have selected, if you don't want to go to the trouble of selecting it every time!
6. Delete a board
  * This'll bring up a list of boards, and you can pick which board you'd like to delete. Be careful, this can't be undone!
7. Delete a sound
  * This brings up a list of sounds and photos for your current board.
  * Choose an item to delete, and off it'll go!
  * Be careful, like deleting a board, this can't be undone.
  * Deleting a sound deletes its photo choice as well.
## Branch Design
The develop branch is the latest working "beta" version of the program, with all the little bells and whistles I'm adding onto it.
The master branch is the "release" version of the code, the latest version of the program that I'd consider ready for the general public. (The first commit is just my initial working idea)
The feat/ branches are the branches where I actually develop new and exciting features. 
The above is my standard branch design choices for all my projects, and unless otherwise stated, that's how I have things set up.
